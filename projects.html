                <h3>About the Project</h3>
                <p>
                    This was one of my earliest projects that I created from scratch.  This is a stylized text adventure game that I created using C++.  The game is a
                    simple text based adventure game that allows the user to explore a dungeon and fight monsters.  This all runs in the windows console, in the future
                    I may update this project to have a GUI.

                <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
                <p>
                    This project was my starting point for most of my programming knowledge. Learning a language like C++ was a great way to learn the fundamentals 
                    of programming and how to think like a programmer.  Understanding how basic functions work and how memory managment works was a great way to 
                    learn how to program.  This project made me realize the importance of planning and designing a project before starting to code.  I had many 
                    issues refactoring the project because I had not thought of the data structures I was going to use before starting to code.

                <h3>About the Project</h3>
                <p>
                    This was a project I took on as a final project after learning C#.  It is a simple business management system that allows users to manage their
                    inventory, Expenses, Sales, and Marketing.  This was the first project I decided to use an external library to manipualte and store data. I used
                    CSVHelper to read and write data to CSV files.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
                <p>
                    This Project was the first time I had wanted to work on a system to store data from the program.  I decided to use CSV files as it was a simple
                    way to store data and I was able to find a library that made it easy to read and write to CSV files.  This project was a great way to learn about
                    how to load and save data to files on the users system.  I plan to update this project into a web application using the knowledge I have gained.

                <p>
                    This was my latest project after learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in my courses as well as taking external courses.  This acts as my personal
                    portfolio that I can use to showcase my projects and skills.  This project will be continually updated as I learn new skills and create new projects.

                <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
                <p>
                    I believe this was my favourite project overall as it really let me put my creativity to use.  I was able to use my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and
                    JavaScript to create a website that I can be proud to show to others.  I was able to use my knowledge of CSS to create a responsive website with
                    fluid animations and a clean design.  I was also able to use my knowledge of JavaScript to create a dynamic website that allows users to interact
                    with the website and view my projects.  This project really helped me solidify my knowledge of how web design works and the many factors that go
                    into creating visually appealing websites.

                <p>
                    This project was created as a part of a course on JavaScript Development by Jonas Schmedtmann.
                    The project is a fictional bank website that allows users to log in, transfer money, request a loan, and close their account. The project was
                    created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

                <hr>
                <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
                <p>
                    This Project was the first major application we created in the course.  It was a great way to learn how to use JavaScript to manipulate the DOM and
                    create a dynamic website.  It was also a great way to learn how to use JavaScript objects and arrays to store and manipulate data.  This was a good
                    starting foundation that I built upon in later projects.  Coming from C++ and C# I found this first project a slight challenge to adapt to a different
                    language and syntax, but I was able to overcome this challenge and learn a lot in the process.

                <p>
                    This was the second project in my JavaScript course.  It was our first project that used a third party library.  The project uses the Leaflet library
                    to create a map that allows users to add workouts to the map.  The project was created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript. The Leaflet library was used to
                    create the map and the Geolocation API was used to get the users location.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
                <p>
                    This Project was the first time using an external library as well as learning about APIs.  Learning about API requests and responses was a great way to
                    learn about asynchronous JavaScript and how loading content from external sources affects the user experience.  This project prompted me to look into
                    various external libraries and APIs that I could use in future projects.  This also really made me understand the importance of optimizing our code for
                    all users, including those with slower internet connections.

                <p>
                    This project was our final project in my JavaScript course, it was a culmination of everything we learned in the course.  The project uses a custom
                    API created by Jonas Schmedtmann to get recipe data.  The project allows users to search for recipes, view the recipe, and create Recipes that can
                    then be saved to local storage.  The project was created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript.  The project also uses the Parcel bundler to bundle the project
                    files.

                <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
                <p>
                    This was a great final project that helped me to solidify my knowledge of JavaScript and how to use it to create a dynamic website.  This project also
                    helped me to learn about the importance of bundling our code and how it can help to optimize our code for production.  It was my first time actually
                    getting code ready for a production environment and it was a great learning experience.  Having to get my code ready for production and hosting it on
                    Netlify proved to be a challenge as there was some issues with compaitbility between Parcel and the Fractional library that I used for the project.  I
