                <h2>Personal Information</h2>
                My name is Aaron, a 28-year-old Canadian Programmer with a passion for code and technology.
                With a strong foundation in core programming languages such as C++, C#, and JavaScript, I have
                spent the majority of my time honing my skills during my studies as well as a personal hobby.
                <br />
                <br />
                One of my greatest strengths is my ability to learn and adapt to new situations. I have spent
                the last 8 years studying at the college level which has let me develop excellent time management
                skills and learning habits.  I pride myself on my ability to pick up new programming languages and
                concepts quickly and efficiently.  I am self-motivated and excel at my work because coding is
                more than just a job to me, it is a passion.
                <br />
                <br />
                From my interest in Artificial Inteligence and learning how neuroscience applies to our understanding
                of how a sythetic mind could be created, to my love of video games and the technology that goes into
                creating something that can be enjoyed by millions of people.  I am always looking to learn more and
                expand my knowledge of programming and technology as a whole.
                <br />
                <br />
                My Current focus is on full stack web development. I am currently working on various projects using
                React, Redux, SASS, Node.js, Express.js, Passport.js, JWT, MongoDB, and Mongoose. I am also focusing 
                on the software production lifecycle and the Agile Development Methodology.
